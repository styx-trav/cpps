strings get a bunch of functions attached, beyond .length and .begin or .end
including adjacent functions like &istream& getline(istream& is, string&str, char delim);
which can be used with (std::cin, str) if needed, though std::cin.getline(str, size) works fine
	//wonder if the regular getline could work like that, too
<fstream> for file streams
class ofstream/ifstream/fstream (out, in, both) and its member funcs
void open(char *file, ios::openmode mode) ios::in for reading, ios::out for writing, ios::app for append, etc.


getline, then find content in string (specifically the find function, which returns size_t pos)
write before string1, then string2, then after string1, on repeat until end of line
repeat
