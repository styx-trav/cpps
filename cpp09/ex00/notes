alright alright ::

so, first parsing -> database, prep work;
container choice : i think map ? like, string to float tab in neat little rows;
check the input : correct dates, correct order, correct floats (0-1000);
order them into the map : push_new_row("date_string", float value);

second parsing -> file acquisition, on site;
same container choice, string to int;
check the input : correct dates, correct ints (0-1000);

matching info (on loop) :
match date to best of ability (last under or equal date, if under first error massage);
multiply our int to our float;
display results; move on to the next line;
