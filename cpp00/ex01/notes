overhaul :: try using getline for stuff
string stream ? to use
<sstream>
	streams are good for catching releasing the same info in different types (like str to int, etc.)
	stream << string_input
	stream >> int_output
	(for example)

	can also be useful to clear stuff out once used so no data scrunges together -- .clear()

handle ctrl-d/eof within ::cin input == punctual cin.eof() checks, then shut down the program if is
 and use ::cin.ignore() to discard leftover info if there is
 
 okay, we will need to use getline then, despite my best efforts truly
 
 Alright looks good, will be back maybe for a stress test
