okay, so next up ::

comparison :: returns a boolean (check that float to int comparisons still work ?
arithmetic :: returns new int post operation (maybe figure out if we need diff methods)
increment/decrement :: returns old int value and moves referenced variable for pre
			returns moved value
			:: on this one, maybe fix an epsilon value ?
min/max :: returns reference to the wanted Fixed object


alright, pretty far along !! had to fix up the rest of the code because i didn't realize i wasn't allowed to use friend (dick move), but it's fixed now

next up :: min maxers, and decide if we want to do the bsp last exercise - seems fun
