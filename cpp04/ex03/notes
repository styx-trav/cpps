still deciding, so lets see what is actually asked of us

first an abstract class to build off of ::
	AMateria, with ::
		a non virtual getType("ice" or "cure");
		a virtual clone (will return a pointer instance of the type its used from)
		a virtual use (takes a ref to an ICharacter class obj and ice attacks, cure heals)

then her two derived classes ::
	Ice :: as seen above;
	Cure :: as seen above;

another abstract class ICharacter, with all virtuals (pure except dest)::
		a getName;
		an equip (in our inventory[4], filling the first empty slot found);
		an unequip (inventory[index] unequipped, do not delete);
		a use (inventory[index]->use(target));
		!!during copy, delete Materias before replacing them (deep copies, also)
